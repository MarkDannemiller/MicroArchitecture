  - Verify instruction memory access timing

- [ ] **DOF Stage Testbench**
  - Test instruction decode for all instruction types
  - Verify register file read operations
  - Test immediate value extension logic
  - Verify control signal generation for different opcodes
  - Test MuxA and MuxB operations

- [ ] **EX Stage Testbench**
  - Test all ALU operations with different operands
  - Verify flag generation (Z, N, V, C)

- [ ] **WB Stage Testbench**
  - Verify correct data selection based on MD signal
  - Test register write operations
  - Verify timing of write-back operations

## 2. Data Hazard Testing

- [ ] **RAW (Read After Write) Hazard Tests**
  - Test consecutive dependent instructions (e.g., ADD R1, R2, R3 followed by SUB R4, R1, R5)
  - Create test cases with varying distances between dependent instructions
  - Verify results with and without forwarding

- [ ] **WAW (Write After Write) Hazard Tests**
  - Test instructions that write to the same register in sequence
  - Verify that the later instruction's result takes precedence

- [ ] **WAR (Write After Read) Hazard Tests**
  - Test scenarios where a register is read and then written to
  - Verify that the read operation uses the original value

## 3. Data Hazard Stalling Implementation

- [ ] **Hazard Detection Unit**
  - Design and implement a hazard detection unit
  - Add stall generation logic based on detected hazards
  - Implement pipeline register control for stalls

- [ ] **Stalling Testbench**
  - Test stall generation for RAW hazards without forwarding
  - Verify correct PC and pipeline register behavior during stalls
  - Measure performance impact of stalling

## 4. Data Forwarding Implementation

- [ ] **Forwarding Unit**
  - Design and implement forwarding logic for EX-EX, MEM-EX, and WB-EX paths
  - Add multiplexers for forwarded data selection
  - Implement forwarding control signals

- [ ] **Forwarding Testbench**
  - Test all forwarding paths with various instruction sequences
  - Compare performance with and without forwarding
  - Verify correct results for dependent instructions
  - Test corner cases where multiple forwarding paths are active

## 5. Branch Prediction Implementation

- [ ] **Static Branch Prediction**
  - Implement a simple static prediction scheme (e.g., predict not taken)
  - Add prediction verification logic

- [ ] **Dynamic Branch Prediction**
  - Implement a 2-bit saturating counter scheme
  - Design and implement branch target buffer (BTB)
  - Add logic for updating prediction history

- [ ] **Branch Prediction Testbench**
  - Test branch prediction accuracy with various branch patterns
  - Measure performance impact of branch prediction
  - Test branch prediction recovery from mispredictions
  - Verify operation of branch target buffer

## 6. Additional Improvement Suggestions

- [ ] **Pipeline Visualization**
  - Create a visualization tool/script to display pipeline state over time
  - Add debug signals to track instruction flow through pipeline stages

- [ ] **Performance Metrics**
  - Implement CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) measurement
  - Track pipeline bubbles and stalls
  - Measure branch misprediction rates

- [ ] **Comprehensive Program Tests**
  - Create small but realistic program sequences (sorting, searching, etc.)
  - Test procedure calls and returns
  - Implement nested loop tests

- [ ] **Exception Handling**
  - Implement and test invalid instruction detection
  - Add overflow and other arithmetic exception handling
  - Test exception recovery

- [ ] **Memory Hierarchy Testing**
  - Implement a simple cache model
  - Test memory access patterns and their impact on performance
  - Measure memory-related stalls

- [ ] **Regression Test Suite**
  - Organize all tests into a regression suite
  - Add automated test pass/fail checking
  - Create a test coverage report generation system

## 7. Implementation Strategy

1. Start with individual pipeline stage tests to ensure each component works correctly
2. Implement and test data hazard detection and stalling
3. Add forwarding paths to improve performance
4. Implement and test branch prediction
5. Integrate performance metrics and visualizations
6. Develop comprehensive program tests
7. Create regression test suite for continual validation

This approach builds up the pipeline verification incrementally, ensuring each component works before adding more complex features.
